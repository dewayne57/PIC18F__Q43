 *            interrupt generated from either port will activate both pins.
 *            If 0, the interrupt pins are not connected and can be used to 
 *            differentiate interrupts.  
 * SEQOP ---- If 1, the register address pointer is not incremented by 1 
 *            after each read or write operation.  If 0, the register 
 *            address is incremented by 1 after each read or write 
 *            operation to a register.
 * DISSLW --- If 1, slew rate control for the SDA pint is disabled.  If 0,
 *            slew rate control is enabled.
 * HAEN ----- If 1, the address pins are enabled, and if 0, the address pins
 *            are disabled.  This only applies to the MCP23S17 (SPI version)
 *            and the MCP23017 (I2C version) address pins are always enabled.
 * ODR ------ If 1, the interrupt output pin is configured as an open-drain
 *            output.  If 0, the pin is configured as totem-pole drive.
 * INTPOL --- If 1, the interrupt output is assumed to be active when HIGH.
 *            If 0, the interrupt output is assumed to be active when LOW.
